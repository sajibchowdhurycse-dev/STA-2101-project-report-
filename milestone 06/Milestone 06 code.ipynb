    "    [Conditional Probability's Effect:\n",
    "The conditional probability $P(A \\mid B) \\approx 0.6200$ (High Stress given Undergraduate) was slightly lower than the marginal probability $P(A) \\approx 0.6357$ (High Stress overall). This means that being an Undergraduate slightly decreases the likelihood of a student reporting a High Academic Stress Index compared to the general population of students in this dataset. Conditional probability provided a key refinement, suggesting that the problem of high stress is not uniformly distributed across all academic stages.]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence of Events:**\n",
    "    [The events A (High Stress Index $\\ge 4$) and B (Undergraduate Student) were found to be Dependent. This was concluded because the empirical joint probability ($P(A \\cap B) \\approx 0.4429$) did not equal the product of the marginal probabilities ($P(A)P(B) \\approx 0.4541$).The dependence implies that the Academic Stage is a real-world factor that influences or is associated with the level of academic stress a student reports. Since they are dependent, knowing a student is an undergraduate provides non-trivial information about their stress rating.]\n",
    "3. ** Normal Distribution Fit:**\n",
    "    [Normal Distribution Fit:The numerical variable, 'Rate your academic stress index', did not fit the Normal distribution well. The data exhibited a strong negative (left) skew, clustered heavily at the higher stress scores (4 and 5). This was supported by the Mean ($\\mu=3.72$) being lower than the Median ($4.00$) and the visible non-bell shape of the histogram.Non-normality affects many common parametric statistical tests (like t-tests or ANOVA) that assume data is normally distributed.1 Using these tests on highly skewed data can lead to invalid p-values and unreliable conclusions, requiring the use of non-parametric alternatives or data transformations.]\n",
    "4. **Real-World Application:**\n",
    "   [Bayes' Rule in Medical Diagnosis:Bayes' Rule is foundational in determining the probability of a disease, given a positive test result (2$P(\\text{Disease} \\mid \\text{Positive Test})$).3For example, imagine a rare disease $D$ ($P(D)$ is low) and a test that is $99\\%$ accurate ($P(\\text{Positive} \\mid D)$ is high). A physician must use Bayes' Rule:$$P(\\text{Disease} \\mid \\text{Positive}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Positive} \\mid \\text{Disease}) \\times P(\\text{Disease})}{P(\\text{Positive})}$$Because the prior probability $P(D)$ is often very low, the posterior probability $P(\\text{Disease} \\mid \\text{Positive})$ might still be low even with a highly accurate test. This rule prevents doctors from misinterpreting a positive result for a rare disease as a near-certain diagnosis, guiding further diagnostic steps and treatment decisions.]"
