👨‍🎓 **Student Name:** *Sajib Chowdhury*
🆔 **Student ID:** *242014141*



## 📘 **Abstract**

This project explores the relationship between **academic pressure**, **peer influence**, and **coping strategies** among undergraduate students. Using the *Academic Stress Level Maintenance Dataset* from Kaggle, the study applies **descriptive statistics**, **probability distributions**, **hypothesis testing**, and **regression analysis** to identify major stressors and how coping methods impact students' stress levels and academic outcomes.

The goal is to highlight patterns that can help universities design more effective **stress management programs** and **student support systems** to promote mental well-being.



## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

* 🔹 Identify significant factors — such as **peer influence**, **family expectations**, **study environment**, **competition**, and **motivation** — that affect the academic stress index.
* 🔹 Examine the **relationship between coping mechanisms** and stress reduction.
* 🔹 Apply key **statistical techniques** (descriptive statistics, correlation, hypothesis testing, regression modeling).
* 🔹 Use regression models to predict **academic stress behavior**.
* 🔹 Provide **data-driven recommendations** for improving academic wellness and university support systems.

## 📈 **Key Visuals & Analysis**

* 📊 Descriptive summary tables (mean, median, standard deviation).
* 🔥 Correlation heatmap showing relationships between stress index and predictors.
* 📦 Boxplots comparing stress levels across coping-strategy groups.
* 📉 Regression plots illustrating effects of **motivation** and **peer pressure**.
* 🧠 Probability distribution of academic stress index.
* 📊 Hypothesis testing results with **p-values and statistical interpretations**.



## 💬 **Findings Summary**

✅ Students with **high academic expectations** and **peer competition** experience significantly higher stress.
✅ **Effective coping strategies** — such as time management and motivation — strongly reduce stress.
✅ **Family expectations** and **peer influence** are found to be the most consistent external stressors.
✅ Regression analysis reveals that **motivation** and a **positive study environment** play the most influential roles in stress control.
