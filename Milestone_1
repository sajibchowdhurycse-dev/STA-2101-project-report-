\begin{abstract}
This project investigates the intricate relationship between academic pressure, peer influence, and coping strategies among undergraduate students. Utilizing the publicly available Kaggle dataset \textit{“Academic Stress Level Maintenance Dataset”}, the study applies a range of statistical techniques—including descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis—to examine patterns in students’ academic stress levels. The goal is to identify the most influential stress factors and understand how different coping mechanisms contribute to maintaining psychological well-being and academic performance.

\section{Milestone 1: Dataset Selection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dataset Name:} Academic Stress Level Maintenance Dataset

    \item \textbf{Dataset URL:} \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayeshaimran123/academic-stress-level-maintenance-dataset}

    \item \textbf{Description:} 
    The \textit{Academic Stress Level Maintenance Dataset} contains responses gathered from undergraduate students regarding various dimensions of academic stress. The variables in the dataset capture multiple aspects, including peer influence, academic expectations from family, study environment, and the coping mechanisms students adopt to manage stress. Additionally, it provides data on students’ self-assessed competition levels, motivation, and overall stress index. 

    This dataset was selected because it offers valuable insight into how social and environmental factors influence students’ academic well-being. By analyzing this data, the project aims to uncover significant trends and correlations between stress triggers and coping behaviors. The findings from this analysis may contribute to a better understanding of how universities and educators can design effective support systems to promote mental health and reduce stress in academic settings.
